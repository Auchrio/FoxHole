# FoxHole
FoxHole is a stealth VPN deployment for Red Team operations. Leveraging the Luckfox Pico Mini B’s tiny footprint, it serves as a "plug-and-forget" remote access point. It establishes an encrypted outbound WireGuard tunnel to bypass NAT, ensuring persistent, low-observable access to internal LANs.
